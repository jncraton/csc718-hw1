CSC718 HW1 Project
------------------

1. How to compile your program?

The three versions of the program can be compiled by running `make` in the project directory against the provided makefile. If you prefer not to use make, or it is not working for you, the programs can also be built directly using `gcc`. The precise build command can be seen in the makefile.

2.  How to run your program?

Programs can be run by invoking them directly on the command line. They take no parameters.

3.  What is the average running time of your program?

These programs should run forever without terminating. They are simply waiting for HTTP requests indefinitely.

4.  What are the expected output results when I run your program?

The programs may print some debugging information to stdout, but the main expectation is that they respond to HTTP reqeusts on port 8080.


5. Any descriptions which may help me to compile, run, and verify your answers. (FYI: I check every programming assignment turned in!)

There shouldn't be anything additional required, but feel free to reach out if you are having any difficulties.
